# simulator.py

Simulates the population and the effect of vaccines and treatments.

# policy.py

It has the parent Policy class, and a default implementation of a random policy.

# test_policy.py

It implements a simple test for the policies. You need to build your own code based on test_policy.py for analysing your policy. However, maintain the same method calls:
- Policy.get_action()
- Policy.observe()
- Population.vaccinate()
- Population.treat()
