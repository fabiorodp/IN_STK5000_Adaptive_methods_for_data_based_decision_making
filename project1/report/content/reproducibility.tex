\section{Reproducibility}
\label{chap:Reproducibility}

This project can be reproducible by the code stored at our GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/fabiorodp/IN_STK5000_Adaptive_methods_for_data_based_decision_making/tree/main/project1}{https://github.com/fabiorodp/IN\_STK5000\_ Adaptive\_methods\_for\_data\_based\_decision\_making/tree /main/project1}. The results are achieved again with a high degree of reliability when the methodologies are replicated by the file \textbf{\textit{main.py}}.
